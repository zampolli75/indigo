The disambiguation of core definitions serves to provide the field with a shared terminology to refer to the phenomenon studied.
The term digital is defined broadly as the discrete representation of signals and data in a binary format which is therefore readable and processable by a digital computer (i.e., a Von Neumann machine).
On the other hand, the terms digitization and digitalization are often considered synonyms both in dictionaries and among scientific papers. In our preliminary research, we find evidence to support that some researchers distinguish the two concepts (e.g., Tilson et al., 2010) assigning one a more technical connotation and to the other one of a socio-technical process. 

Analyzing, for example, the term digitization we can further recognize other points of concern. Digitization is often defined as any action that occurs when physical events, objects, content, and processes are encoded into digital form, therefore creating a digital representation of those events, objects, content and processes (Bailey et al., 2011; Fichman et al., 2014).
Although the above definition encompasses a broad range of cases, we believe this definition is tied to a traditional view of information technology. In fact, today the distinction between physical and digital events, objects, content, and processes is blurring. Increasingly, many resources are born in digital form, therefore making it conceptually challenging to disambiguate what is being digitized. A 2017 report states that more than 50% of traffic performed on the Internet is attributed to Internet bots. Furthermore, as the content is increasingly created natively on digital devices, it is difficult (or even incorrect) to support that what is being encoded in digital form is a physical thing.

Our value proposition is twofold. On the one hand, we consolidate the definitions of digital, digitization, and digitalization that literature provided over the last years. Furthermore, we suggest that the consolidated definitions should be reviewed in accordance with the digital landscape we are currently undergoing.

# Literature review
To map all the different definitions of the three terms we conduct a literature review in the IS journals and conferences. More specifically, we consider papers published in the following journals and conferences:  
-  We consider papers published over the last 15 years in the [IS basket of eight journals](http://ais.site-ym.com/?page=SeniorScholarBasket&hhSearchTerms=%22basket+and+eight%22).
-  We consider papers published over the last five years in the major IS conferences, namely [ICIS](https://aisnet.org/general/custom.asp?page=ICISPage), [AMCIS](https://aisnet.org/?AMCISPage), [ECIS](https://aisnet.org/page/ECISPage), and [PACIS](https://aisnet.org/page/PACISPage).

The selection criteria to presents a two-phase process. Firstly, we identify all those papers that present as keyword one of the following terms: digital, digitization, digitalization. Secondly, we analyze those papers to identify those where a definition of at least one of the three terms of interest is present.

## Categorization
Once all the papers that meet the two-phase criteria are identified, we categorize multiple variables to provide a systematic assessment of the papers.
The variables we deem of interest to our research we find:
* Title
* Authors
* Journal/Conference
* Year: year the paper was published
* Approach: what is the way researchers approach the paper (e.g., theory testing, theory emergent)
* Method: what method is used to conduct the research (e.g., case study, lab experiment, field research)
* Theories used: what are the main theories used to conduct the research
* IT conceptualization: is the IT artifact analyzed or treated as an exogenous factor
* Main constructs: what are the main constructs used
* Main definitions: the most important definitions used or provided in the paper
* Level of analysis: at what organizational/social level the phenomenon is analyzed (e.g., firm-level)
* Intent of the paper: what is the main objective of the research (e.g., assess financial performance of IT initiatives)
