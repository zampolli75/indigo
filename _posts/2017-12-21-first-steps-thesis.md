# What I am investigating

Since the introduction of the LEO 1 in 1951, the first computer used for commercial business applications, the world has undergone tremendous innovations and breakthroughs. The digital revolution of the last four decades is, without doubt, one of the most disruptive transformations humans have experienced since the invention of the electricity, and previously the Gutenberg printing press or the discovery of fire.
Over the last 70 years in computing, the technology evolved from vacuum tubes to the semiconductor, from mainframes to personal computing, from standalone devices to worldwide connected ones, from punch cards to the cloud, from terminals to mobile computing.
Nowadays, digital computers are pervasive in all sectors of the economy; from healthcare to education, from aerospace to oil and gas, from public administrations to financial markets. As venture capitalist Marc Andreessen anticipated in 2011 "we are in the middle of a dramatic and broad technological and economic shift in which software companies are poised to take over large swathes of the economy." (https://a16z.com/2016/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/)

While products and services are increasingly digitally based the Information Systems (IS) field has yet to provide a theoretical explanation for the digital phenomenon. In fact, after four decades of research in this area of research, we still do not have a precise understanding of how resources become digital (here we loosely define resources) or what are their characteristics.
Although the IS field has extensively researched how organizations can leverage Information Technolgy (IT) to create and appropriate value, we believe that the understanding of the underlying characteristics of the digital resources will enable a more comprehensive and novel view of the phenomena.

To provide a clear research stream for my thesis, following I  unbundle in clear and addressable objectives the value proposition of my work.

## Digital, digitalization, digitization
The scientific community should have available a shared terminology to investigate the digital revolution as to identify without ambiguity a specific state, action, or process.
From a preliminary investigation, the IS field has yet to provide definitions for the terms digital, digitization, and digitalization that are mutually exclusive and comprehensive of all the use cases that currently exist or are bound to in the foreseeable future.
We believe it is valuable to conduct a literature research of all IS papers that defined these three terms over the course of the last 15 years to consolidate and provide punctual, mutually exclusive, and comprehensive definitions.

## Characteristics of digital resources
The potential for creation and appropriation of value of digital resources depends tightly on the characteristics of the digital resources. We anticipate that the type of digital resource influences its underlying characteristics; therefore not all characteristics are common to all digital resources. In contrast, the literature treats all digital resources without distinction and assumes that they all have the same underlying characteristics (e.g., low cost of replicability).
In this stage of the research, we conduct a literature review to identify all the characteristics that have been attributed to digital resources and we provide a framework to categorize when and why are these characteristics valid for some resources and not for others.
