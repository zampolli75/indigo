# AWS Command Line Interface
The best way to interact with AWS services is through the use of the CLI. This enables to use simple commands to upload Lambda functions, download S3 buckets, and many other interactions.
The first step in the configuration process is to install the AWS CLI. I suggest the use of pip as it allows to upgrade and uninstall the the cli seamlessly. Information about how to install ```awscli``` is available in the official [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html).

{% highlight shell %}
pip install awscli --upgrade --user
{% endhighlight %}

We need to check that the AWS CLI is correctly installed.

{% highlight shell %}
aws --version
{% endhighlight %}

After the installation it is possible that the executable is not available from the command line. We need to add the aws executable to the OS's path envrinment variable. This part can problematic as the location of the executable depends on where Python is installed. To complicate things we need to consider that we might have several version of Python installed. I found a couple of resources that help me in understanding where my excecutable was located. [link1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23332147/awscli-not-added-to-path-after-installation) [link2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18419500/how-to-make-mac-os-use-the-python-installed-by-homebrew)

Once identified the correct location of the excetutable we need to update our ```.bash_profile```. After sourcing the ```.bash_profile``` the aws command should be available. 

{% highlight plaintext %}
#create this path to link to the python installation which is needed for AWS CLI
export PATH=$PATH:/Users/joaquinrodriguez/Library/Python/2.7//bin/
{% endhighlight %}

After installing the CLI we need to configure it using our account information. The AWS documentation provides information about how to configure it. At the moment I do not have multiple profiles, but it is advisable to use the ```--profile``` option when configuring the CLI.

{% highlight shell %}
aws configure
{% endhighlight %}
